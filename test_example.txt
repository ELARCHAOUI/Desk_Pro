To whom it may concern,

I am writing to file a formal complaint against the collection agency 'ABC Collections'. 
They have been calling me multiple times a day, including at my workplace, regarding an old medical bill.

I have sent them proof that this bill was paid in full over six months ago, but the calls have not stopped. 
This is causing me significant stress and I need this harassment to stop.

Please help me resolve this issue.

Sincerely,
Jane Doe

URGENT - SUSPECTED FRAUD
I am currently reviewing my latest credit card statement (ending in 4589) and I found a transaction that I absolutely do not recognize.
It is a charge of â‚¬127.50 dated yesterday, from "GlobalWebServices.com". 
I have never heard of this site and I have not purchased anything from them.
I believe my card has been compromised. 
Can you please block my card immediately and initiate a dispute procedure for this transaction?
Thank you for your prompt assistance.

Hello,I am trying to use the new check deposit feature through the mobile app, but it is not working.
 Every time I take a photo of the check, the app tells me "Error: the image quality is insufficient."
I have tried several times with good lighting, on a dark and flat surface, but I still get the same error message.
 My phone is a recent model and the app is updated. It is quite frustrating.
Is there a trick or a procedure to follow?
Thank you.

Dear Sir or Madam,I am contacting you regarding my mortgage loan.
 My last monthly payment, which includes the principal, interest, and the escrow account, appears to have been misapplied.
My bank statement shows that the withdrawal occurred on the 1st of the month, but my online client space indicates a payment delay and penalties have been applied. 
It seems that the funds have not been correctly credited to my loan account.
Could you please investigate this error and correct my balance as soon as possible?Sincerely,Philippe Lemoine
